    "# Computational Inquiry: How to Trust a Machine\n",

    "In CMSE 202 (and 201 before it), you've been building a foundation of experience with fundamental tools and techniques essential to computational scientists.  Even if your interests don't end up taking you to an explicitly computational field of work or study, we still live in a computational world.  Whatever your path, the experience you're gaining better equips you to succeed in such a world.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces an activity that adds another brick to the foundation you're building.  You'll likely find it to be a bit different from your other CMSE classroom experiences.  That's because you'll be engaging in an _inquiry-based activity_.  The goal is to learn through inquiry and investigation, similar to the way science is done.  While it may feel a bit different, some of the scholars and scientists that study how people learn find it to be powerfully effective.  You'll soon be able to judge for yourself, but we hope you'll approach this activity with an open mind and a willingness to try something a bit different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, alright, so what are we actually trying to learn here? What tools and techniques will you get to play with?  I'm glad you asked.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on introducing two concepts: **compartmental models** (which are a framework for describing a set of **ordinary differential equations (ODEs)**) and **finite differences**.  Now, you could easily spend up to an entire course on these.  The point here is to give the class just enough of a shared understanding of these concepts such that you can deploy them in your inquiry.  Some of you may already have some experience with these or related concepts, in which case this notebook can refresh and reinforce.  In either case, the plan for this activity is not to go into all the details and nuances, but to learn a bit and get some practical experience.  If your calculus is rusty or non-existent, there's no need to worry.  While we'll be playing with calculus concepts like differential equations and derivatives, neither past knowledge of them nor a calculus background is required for this activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's because the focus of this activity is to develop practical, technical experience with the computational treatment of these concepts.  Even more, you're going to wrestle with the fundamental question of **how can we trust a machine?**.  What are some of the steps we can take, some of the analysis we can do, to convince ourselves and others that the results of a program running on a complex machine are meaningful?  In our everyday use of computers, they tend to act as mysterious \"black boxes.\"  They do all sorts of things for us and we trust them to even if we don't understand the details, the same way we may trust and use a vehicle even if we don't understand all the details of how it works.  As a student of computational methods, however, you'll be writing your own computer code and using that of others.  In this activity, you'll get to look under the hood a bit and learn some of the ways we can evaluate the quality of a code."

    "In this section, we introduce the notion of a *compartmental model*.  While this modeling framework is often seen in the medical field (e.g. epidemiology, physiology, related medical imaging), it can be used as a general framework for building basic models of many systems of interest in a variety of scientific disciplines.  Compartmental models give us a way of describing how a system evolves over time, leading to something called an **ordinary differential equation (or ODE)**.  These look something like\n",

    "In a calculus course, you learn the formal mathematical definition of equations like this.  Informally, for the purposes of this activity, this differential equation is a way of describing the slope of some function $f(x)$ for any valid value of the independent variable $x$.  The right-hand-side, $g(x)$, gives us this slope.  So $g(0)$ is the slope at $x=0$.  Sometimes we describe a line's slope as \"rise over run,\" or in fraction form: $\\frac{\\mathrm{rise}}{\\mathrm{run}}$.  This is, roughly, what $\\frac{df}{dx}$ is: it tells you the \"rise\" ($df$, change in $f(x)$) over the \"run\" ($dx$, change in $x$).  Lines like $f(x) = ax + b$ have the same slope (in this case, $a$) for _all_ $x$.  Generally, for some unknown, well-behaved function $f(x)$, the slope may be different at different values of $x$.  We'll often call a function \"well-behaved\" or \"differentiable\" if a well-defined slope exists for all $x$.  This is a detail we won't worry about too much here.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A differential equation is said to be an _ordinary_ differential equation if it describes functions of _one_ independent variable (like $f(x)$).  Differential equations of functions that depend on multiple independent variables, such as functions of three spatial coordinates like $f(x, y, z)$, are _partial_ differential equations.  We won't worry about those in this activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The slope of a line is something you've had experience with and have some intuition for, so it's useful to introduce a differential equation this way.  But in the sciences and engineering, it can be useful to understand a differential equation as describing change, describing evolution with respect to some independent variable (often, but not always, either a spatial variable describing lengths like $x$ or a variable describing time like $t$).  These equations give us a powerful, mathematically robust way of modeling a system's behavior over time.  If we can develop a set of equations that describe this change, we can then use them to make predictions about a system's behavior, about what it will look like tomorrow based on what it looks like today.  In this activity, you will see concrete examples of this.\n",

Any given compartment may have (1) input from or output to an external function (like $u(t)$ into $C_1$ proportional to $K_1$), (2) flow out into another compartment (like from $C_1$ to $C_2$ proportional to $k_3$), (3) flow in from another compartment (like from $C_2$ to $C_1$ proportional to $k_4$), or (4) output that leaves the system (like that marked with constants $k_2$ and $k_5$).

Thus, with this basic framework you can model different systems, even if both models are 2-compartment.\n",

This means people are either susceptible (S) to infection or are infectious (I) themselves.  Highly original scientists calls this the SI model of disease spread.

    "At this point, you should be equipped with enough understanding of compartmental models to be able to carry out an inquiry into what ODE models like this can tell us and what constraints there may be when solving them computationally.  In summary, compartmental models are a framework for modeling systems that can be decomposed into interacting compartments through which some quantity (information, infection, nuclear matter) flows.\n",

    "So, we have these things called ODEs (oridnary differential equations), which are at the heart of compartmental models (as well as many other modeling techniques).  What can we do with them?

And again, what can we do to build confidence that the predictions of a machine we've programmed are trustworthy?  In this inquiry activity, you'll end up investigating these questions.  But before getting there, we need to introduce one more essential computational tool you'll need to work with mathematical equations on a computer: **finite differences**, in particular we'll see one of the most fundamental such differences: the **forward Euler method**."

    "Finite differences are one technique for approximating a derivative (in other words, the left-hand-side of an ODE).  In calculus and most math we may use day-to-day, mathematical functions tend to be continuous.  This means that even in the interval $x \\in [0,1]$ there are an infinite number of possible values $x$ can take on when you calculate $f(x)$.  On a computer, however, we have a finite amount of memory available to represent numbersand in practice there's a limit to the smallest rational number you can represent.  A finite difference addresses this by breaking the numberline up into discrete chunks and approximates a derivative using data points from this discrete set of possible $x$ values.\n",

For the purposes of this activity, we'll just introduce one of the most basic finite difference methods: **Forward Euler**.
